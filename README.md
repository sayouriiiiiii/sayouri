This Telegram bot allows users to enter trades directly from Telegram and get a detailed look at the risk-to-reward ratio with profit, loss, and calculated lot size. You can change specific settings such as allowed symbols, risk factor, and more from your personalized Python script and environment variables.

The FX Signal Copier Telegram Bot makes use of the MetaAPI cloud forex trading API for MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 to create a connection to a user's MetaTrader account to gather information such as account balance, open positions, and permissions to enter and close trades. The API works for both live and demo accounts.

Official REST and WebSocket API documentation for MetaAPI: https://metaapi.cloud/docs/client/

This bot is deployed using Render.
